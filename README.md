# Market-Basket-Analysis-of-Groceries
This is a simple implementation of Association Rules of Data Mining for the dataset of groceries. Along with the use of library, it has the computation of association metrics without the use of direct libraries. 

Features:
  - EDA of the dataset
  -  Rather than one-hot encoding of the items and computing mean, the support is computed with the total count every time.
  
Improvements Possible:
  - Better visualization networks and implementation for recommendations!
